        <name>Waumbec Mill</name>
        <description><![CDATA[The Waumbec Mill building, constructed in 1900, was built on the site of two earlier buildings (Amoskeag Mills #4 & #5 Mill No. 4 was built in 1848 with an extension added in 1872 and Mill No 5 was built in 1855). Waumbec Mills, Inc., the firm that took over this building after the Amoskeag closed, made rayon (artificial silk). Waumbec became one of Manchester’s largest employers.<br>Developer Arthur Sullivan, whose firm bought the 500,000-square foot Waumbec Mill in 1995 for $15,000 and back taxes, recalls it as “a time where people didn’t feel secure walking down the Millyard’s streets, especially in the night hours.”]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[This building is Mill No. 3. It was built in 1844-1850 and then rebuilt in 1870. At that point, like many other mills the gabled roof was replaced with a flat one. <br>Mill No. 3 is home to the Millyard Museum and the New Hampshire Scenic and Cultural Byway Visitor Center. Manchester’s millyard is the only urban byway in the state. This building and several others have prominent towers. These housed the main stairways, and most of the towers also served as bell towers.<br>The bells would be rung to announce the starting time, lunchtime, and closing time for the workers.<br>Notice the decorative caps on the ends of the metal tie rods in the outside walls of this and other buildings. These secured the building’s cross beams to the walls. This helped the building to withstand expansion and contraction due to temperature changes and helped it to hold up under the constant vibration of the machinery.]]></description>

        <description>The Mill Girl sculpture represents the thousands of women who worked in these factories during the 19th century. The first mill girls came here from the farms and small towns of New England to earn their own way in life and enjoy new social and educational opportunities. This 1988 sculpture by artist Antoinette Schultze has become a symbol of Manchester and its industrial past.</description>

During the Civil War, when the company could not get cotton from the South, the machine shop manufactured rifles for the Union Army. The company's foundry made over 27,000 muskets and 6,892 Lindner carbines. To protect these operations a brass field cannon was mounted where the Mill Girl sculpture is today. ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[This is the site of Amoskeag’s Mill No. 9, built in 1853, reconstructed in 1880, and later became the Arms Textile Mill.<br>In September 5th of 1957, Antonio Jette, a worker in the card room of the Arms Textile Mill, felt unwell after returning from mass and collapsed on his bed. He never woke up. <br>Over a ten week period in the fall of 1957, a total of nine employees of the textile mill became sick. Two other men and one woman, would suffer similar fates to Jette.  It was the deadliest outbreak of anthrax in the country’s history.<br>A single batch of dark colored Pakistani goat hair, raw material that was used to make the lining of men’s jackets was responsible. As that goat hair worked its way through the Arms, the anthrax spores, which had been hidden in the hair, were sent airborne, floating down like confetti on the workers.<br>And it could have been worse, except for a remarkable twist.<br>In 1957, the United States Army, along with the CDC, happened to be testing a potential anthrax vaccine. Those tests were taking place at four textile mills, including three in Pennsylvania, as well as the Arms Textile Mill in Manchester.<br>When scientists realized what was happening, they halted their trial and gave the vaccine to every worker at Arms Mill.<br>No one else got sick. In fact, that experimental vaccine became the basis for the one given today to soldiers.<br>The Arms Textile Mill continued operating until 1968, when the company went out of business. In 1971, after much planning, the brick building was taken down.<br>“It was one of the largest decontamination projects in the world at the time.<br>Men in white suits sprayed the inside with potent mixtures of chlorine and formaldehyde, and an incinerator was brought on site to burn wood and other materials. The bricks would be buried off-site (in the location of the Fishercats Stadium). And that was that for the Arms.]]></description>

        <name>Gingham Mills</name>
        <description><![CDATA[The two factories connected by an overhead walkway are known as the Gingham Mills. These mills were dedicated to the spinning and weaving of ginghams, a fabric where the yarn is dyed before the fabric is woven (plaids, for example). <br>By 1860, the Amoskeag mills were very successful at producing the course linens used in mattress ticking and sheeting, however, the popular dress cloth industry, like ginghams, were dominated by British factories.  The Amoskeag Mills were unable to produce them because the dyes required were closely guarded secrets and the skill required to produce them did not exist in the United States.  <br>In 1865, the company sent their agent Ezekiel Straw to recruit skilled gingham workers from England and Scotland. As it happened, these workers were facing reduced wages and mill shutdowns, so an offer of paid passage to the United States with a guaranteed job proved very enticing.  <br>Fifty three weavers were brought in from Lancashire England in 1865. In 1868 and 1870 the company brought in skilled gingham weavers, mechanics and dye master James Reid from Glasgow, Scotland. Additionally, Looms were imported from Scotland and were replicated by the Amoskeag machine shop.<br>Shortly thereafter, Gingham became known as one of the Amoskeag Manufacturing Companies' specialties.<br>By 1912, an average day produced 470 miles of ticking, gingham, flannels, madras, chambrays, shirtings, and worsteds. <br>On February 15th, 1886, 100 Gingham workers in mills 7, 8, and 9 went on strike. Differences were resolved and workers returned to work on March 5th.<br>Notice the overhead walkway, similar to the walkways that once connected many of the buildings in the millyard.]]></description>

Natives typically caught fish using a combination of large nets strung across the river. Significant native settlements were sited near the falls, particularly on the high bluffs overlooking the east side of the river.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[What you are currently looking at is the truncated remains of the canals that once delivered the lifeblood that powered Victorian Manchester.<br>The rapid descent of the river here made travel impossible. At the end of the 18th century, local industrialist and visionary, Samuel Blodgett, wanted to open up trade along the Merrimack River from Lowell, MA to Concord, NH. To do this, he envisioned a canal dug parallel to the river that would aid in navigation of ships traveling up and down the River. After gaining the state legislature's approval and leveraging funds from several New Hampshire and Massachusetts state lotteries, Samuel Blodget broke ground on the first of these canals in 1798. The Blodget Canal was completed in 1807.<br>In 1810, Samuel Blodget pushed for the renaming of the small rural town of Derryfield, New Hampshire to Manchester, in honor of Manchester in England, a well-known textile-manufacturing center. <br>"For as the country increases in population, we must have manufactories, and here at my canal will be a manufacturing town -the Manchester of America,"<br>Between 1816 and 1842, $700,000 was collected in tolls for the Blodget Canal.<br>One of the most notable travelers through this canal and set of locks was Henry David Thoreau and his brother John in a small canoe in 1839. Thoreau would later go on to publish an account of his journey as "A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers" in 1849. <br>The Blodget Canal was discontinued in 1854.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Anadromous fish, those that are required to swim upstream to spawn, had their populations begin to decline once the dams were built. This is because the fish were unable to pass the dams to reach their traditional spawning grounds. Overfishing and increasing levels of water pollution also reduced anadromous fish populations.<br>A fish ladder was built at Amoskeag due to legislation passed in Massachusetts and New Hampshire requiring fish ladders to be built when constructing dams. Sadly, this ladder did not work correctly and the anadromous fish population in the Merrimack River collapsed by 1850.<br>In 1989, Public Service of New Hampshire (now Eversource), in cooperation with the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department (NHFG) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), constructed the current fish ladder. The ladder is comprised of 54 pools, each one a foot higher than the preceding one. The pools act as steps, allowing the fish to safely "climb" to the top of the falls, bypassing the hydro station. This ladder was built as part of an effort to restore anadromous fish populations to the Merrimack River. <br>In 1990, a visitor center with an underwater viewing window was built adjacent to the fish ladder to allow visitors to see and learn about anadromous fish. One year later, a learning center was added to provide field trips and science education opportunities to school children. In 1995, the Amoskeag Fishways Partnership, consisting of Public Service of New Hampshire (now Eversource), New Hampshire Audubon, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, was formed to increase environmental education opportunities at the Fishways.]]></description>

        <name>Manchester Locomotive Works</name>
        <description><![CDATA[The site of the Manchester Locomotive Works, which built steam locomotives and fire engines in the 19th century. The main building is still extant.<br>Originally, Amoskeag Locomotive, it began operation in 1855 with 300 men and was capable of producing three engines per year. After an initially promising start, it was forced to close its doors in 1858 from lingering effects of the financial panic of 1857.<br>Manchester purchased the company in 1859, restarted production in 1863, and produced its first engine in 1864. Aretas Blood, originally a blacksmith's apprentice, started off leasing a machine shop, managed the reopened factory, and eventually became the principal owner. The engines produced came to be favorably known in many railroads as "Blood" engines.<br>In 1865, the locomotive works produced 17 engines and purchased a foundry on Elm Street south of the railroad station's freight depot. It was conveniently connected to the Locomotive Works by the railroad track that ran parallel to Canal Street. The foundry operated two furnaces 24 hours a day, enabling the company to control costs and maintain quality by making all of its own castings. In 1873 alone the company used 3.5 million pounds of castings made in the foundry. The furnaces consumed 4,500 tons of coal and 1,000 cords of wood, that year. By 1875 the Locomotive Works employed 700 men, and by the 1880s it had the capacity to produce 150 locomotives a year.<br>In 1877 he bought the steam fire engine business from the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company, and the Locomotive Works took on the production of the famous Amoskeag engines. It is unclear how many fire engines the Locomotive Works produced, but by 1901 it had manufactured 1,793 steam locomotive engines. These were used by railroad lines in the United States, Canada, and South America. The Manchester engines saw service with the Boston & Maine, the Montreal & Ottawa, the St. Louis & Minneapolis, the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, and the Northern Pacific railroad lines. The company manufactured six special engines for the Mount Washington Cog Railway, designed to push tourist-filled passenger cars up a three-mile track to the top of the 6,288-foot peak. All six of these locomotives still exist and one of these, the Ammonoosuc (originally called the Atlas), built in 1875, is still in use. In total, there are ten locomotives manufactured by the Manchester Locomotive Works that still exist.<br>In 1901, Manchester Locomotive Works merged with the American Locomotive Company (ALCO). Production ceased in Manchester in 1913.<br>AURORE EATON - NH Union Leader]]></description>

A tract of land measuring several acres, is divided into garden plots which are planted and tended by the children under the guidance of an expert gardener" ... "The children's playground probably has attracted more attention and called forth more well-deserved commendation than any other one thing this excellent company has done for its employees." ... "A plot of land one hundred feet wide and nearly five hundred feet long, enclosed by an iron fence as ornamental as it is practical, contains a full equipment of modern gymnastic apparatus, swings, chutes, see-saws, and other devices for safe enjoyment. There is a running track, a baseball diamond, and a football field. For the tiny children there is a shelter house, with baby swings and a wading pool. Free band concerts are given here during the summer months prove another source of attraction to this justly popular place. A part of the field is flooded in winter to afford excellent skating in perfect safety. A competent caretaker is always in charge of the grounds."]]></description>

        <name>Flywheel Disaster</name>
        <description><![CDATA[The worst industrial accident of the Amoskeag Mill's history took place here on the morning of Thursday, October 15th 1891.<br>At 9:30 in the morning, engineer Samuel Bunker descended into the pit below mill number seven, built in 1869, that housed the great Corliss engine that powered Mills four, five, seven, and eight. The power output had been inconsistent all morning and Bunker was going to inspect it. It was the last time he was seen alive.<br>The Corliss Steam Engine was an engineering marvel that had been the star of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Pennsylvania. The Amoskeag installed this one in 1883 and was the largest in New England, capable of delivering 2,000 hp to the mills. A system of gates allowed the Merrimack to turn the shafts when water levels were sufficient, or exclusively on steam when water levels were low.  <br>Moments before the disaster, the power coming from the Corliss was becoming more and more unstable. The carding machines in mill number five to the south were stopping from lack of power, while the looms in mill number eight were running at such a dangerous speed they had to be shut down. One loom had its safety fail and no loom ever ran so fast before or since. An assistant engineer looked through a window into the engine room and could see sparks flying from the 42 inch wide main belt as the sixty eight ton, two story tall flywheel rotated at sixty one revolutions per minute. The assistant was in the process of cutting power to the engine when it failed.<br>With an explosive sound that shook the neighboring mills, the flywheel broke apart, smashing through the south wall, bringing down the roof, and collapsing the second floor. Huge chunks of cast iron, one weighing over 800 pounds were flung into the air up to 200 feet. Metal shot through the windows of nearby mills showering workers with debris and glass. In total, three mill workers (Samuel Bunker, Ada Cram, and Mary Kane) were killed and eight more were injured. Some severely.<br>The accident was attributed to to a failure of the mechanism that connected the flywheel to the shafts combined with a casting defect in the flywheel.]]></description>
